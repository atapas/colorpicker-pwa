Feel free to contribute by opening an issue if there's any bug in this application. You are also welcome to add features to it like:

- Make the update alert better. Right now, I use the browser's window alert.
- Build a better caching strategy. Right now, it uses the `Cache Only` strategy. 
- You can use Faker to generate the data and cache. The faker code is present already.
